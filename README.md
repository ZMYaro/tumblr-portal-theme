Tumblr _Portal_ Theme
===================

A Tumblr theme based on elements from _Portal_ test chambers.  It is based on what used to be the default Tumblr theme, and some pieces of that theme still exist in the code.

##To use with your blog:
1. Go to your Tumblr dashboard.
2. Select “Customize” on the right sidebar.
3. Select “Edit HTML >” near the top of the left sidebar.
4. Replace the HTML with the contents of tumblr.html from the repo.
5. Select the green “Update Preview” button at the top right of the HTML pane.
6. If it looks good, select the blue ”Save” button.

Certain customization options are available; not all have been tested.  Feel free to report issues in GitHub.  I recommend Background color #2D3337 and ContentBackground color #F8F9F5.

While I cannot control what you do on your own blog, I do ask that you leave the links in the sidebar giving credit to Valve for creating _Portal_ and myself for writing this theme.
